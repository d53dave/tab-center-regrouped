- Better, prettier style
  - Follow more closely Firefox’s colors (Photon)
  - Integrate better with custom themes
  - Separate active and contextual identity indicator so it’s easier to distinguish
- Has a bottom shadow in tab list when it’s possible to scroll down
- Use native context menus and use same items as Firefox’s default menus
